h2. Oh-my-zsh

Clone repo using ==--==recursive

bq. git clone ==--==recursive git://github.com/aasplund/myScripts.git

h2. Setup

*NOTE*:If you already have any of the provided script files you should back them up in case you want to go back to your original settings. I.e cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc.orig

Run the setup.sh script. 

bq. sh setup.sh

The script will create symlinks in you home catalog to all the script files provided in _myScripts_. If Dropbox is installed the script will also create a symlink to the project in the Dropbox folder (works only if Dropbox is installed on the default path i.e $HOME/Dropbox).
